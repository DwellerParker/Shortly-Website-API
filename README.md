## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot in this project creating an website connected to an API, I did have some trouble connecting user submitted inputs if they have the https.No matter what I was doing I kept getting a type error even when using replace and looking up ways to use regex to take out https. I learned how to better use position absolute and relative in this challenge which was helpful when it comes to making future layouts. 



### Continued development

I would love to keep improving my JS when it comes to the frontend side I am starting to understand why the fundamentals is important. I have to work on objects a bit more so I can more concise functions.
